npm create vite@latest . // it used to create react app and vite is bundled or toolkit.we used(.) create app directly in current folder, don't ask name.
npm install
npm run dev

npm i axios // we used this pakage to integrate API's 
note : it provides more flexibility and better user experience, more functionality.

eg: useEffect(() =>{
    axios.get('http://localhost:5000/jokes')
    .then((response) =>{                
      setJokes(response.data)   //when we use axios we dont need to parse our data, becz axios do same automatically.
    })
    .catch((error)=>{
      console.log(error.message);
    })
  })

Cors = it is stand for "cross origin resourse sharing".
notes : if frontend and backend both ports,url different or ip address, that time we got cors error in frontend.
        we will have to allow origin our json data to authorise client.

-------- Set Proxy in Vite -------------

1- search "proxy vite" 
2- add proxy code in "vite.config.js"


---------Bad Practice but working --------------


1- command for make build in frontend side.
> npm run build

2- copy dist folder from frontend and paste in backend side.

3- write code in server.js backend side; 

app.use(express.static('dist')) //dist is name and location of frontend dist build file.
